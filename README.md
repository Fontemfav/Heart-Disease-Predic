# Heart-Disease-Predic
This project is a Heart Disease Prediction System built with Machine Learning.
It uses medical data (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, chest pain type, heart rate, ECG results, and more) to determine whether a person is at risk of heart disease.

The goal is to help with early detection and support healthcare decisions using data-driven analysis.

What the Model Does

The model learns patterns from a heart disease dataset and predicts whether a patient is:

At Risk of Heart Disease
or

Not At Risk

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making clinical predictions.

Key Features

Predicts the likelihood of heart disease

Handles noisy or missing data through preprocessing

Uses multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, etc.)

Visualizes data relationships (heatmaps, pairplots, correlations)

Evaluates models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports

Beginner-friendly and well-structured Python code

Tech Stack

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook or .py scripts

How to Open and Run the Code on Your Laptop
1. Download the Project

Go to the GitHub repository

Click the green Code button

Choose Download ZIP

2. Unzip the File

Locate the ZIP in your Downloads folder

Right-click → Extract All (Windows)

4. Install Required Libraries

Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Or, if a requirements file exists:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the Code
Option A — Using Jupyter Notebook

If your project includes .ipynb:

jupyter notebook


Open the notebook

Run each cell step-by-step

Option B — Using Python Scripts

If your project uses .py:

python heart_prediction.py


(Replace with the actual filename.)
